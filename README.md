# climwin_demo
Using the 'climwin' package to determine climate predictors of laying date

This is a simple demonstration of `climwin` to 1) determine the window in which climatic conditions have an influence on breeding phenology in American kestrels in SE Idaho, USA (2008--2018), and 2) how well climate during this window can predict average laydates for years not included in the analysis.
