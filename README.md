Using the 'climwin' package to determine climate predictors of laying date

This is a simple demonstration of `climwin` to 1) determine the window in which climatic conditions have an influence on breeding phenology in American kestrels in SE Idaho, USA, and 2) how well climate during this window can predict average laydates for years not included in the analysis.
